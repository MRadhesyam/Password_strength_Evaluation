#  Password Strength Evaluation Report

**Date:** 14/08/2025
**Tool:** Online Password Strength Checkers  

---

##  Objective
To create multiple passwords with varying complexity, test their strength, and understand how complexity impacts security.

---

##  Passwords Tested
| Password Example | Complexity | Strength Rating | Estimated Crack Time | Feedback |
|------------------|------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------|
| 12345678 | Weak | Very Weak | < 1 sec | Common dictionary word |
| power123 | Weak | Weak | Seconds | Predictable pattern |
| Pow1234 | Medium | Weak | Hours | Too short, needs symbols |
| P@ssw0rd2025! | Strong | Strong | Centuries | Good mix of characters |
| king_Stone_hit@1hard!rock& | Very Strong | Excellent | Millions of years | Excellent length & variety |

##  Observations
- Weak passwords can be cracked instantly by brute force or dictionary attacks.
- Adding numbers and symbols improves strength, but length is still critical.
- Long passphrases are best for both memorability and security.

---

##  Best Practices
1. Use **12â€“16+ characters**.
2. Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
3. Avoid dictionary words and personal info.
4. Use passphrases where possible.
5. Store passwords in a password manager.
6. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).

---

##  Common Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack:** Tries all possible combinations.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses common passwords from lists.
- **Phishing:** Tricks user into revealing credentials.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Uses leaked passwords from other sites.

---

##  Conclusion
Password strength depends on both **length** and **complexity**.  
The best practice is to use a **long, random passphrase** combined with MFA for maximum security.
